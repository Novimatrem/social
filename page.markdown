Hello!
I'm zoey, aka Novimatrem. 

Welcome to an alternative to social media solution, that is read-only, and with only a single user- me!

Because I have been bullied off of social media by awful bigoted ableist transphobic harassers, I have created this. It relies around RSS, and requires you have an RSS feed reader client. I recommend FeedReader on Linux, and RSSOwl on Windows.

Send an e-mail to TheNovimatrem@protonmail.ch with your email client of choice, with the subject line being "RE: Social post - The title of the post". For example, "RE: Social post - A beautiful screenshot". (without quotes)
